## 💡 About Me


I’m Michael Debuo, a passionate Software Engineer and Creative Technologist from Techiman, Ghana.
Driven by curiosity and creativity, I explore how technology can be used to build solutions that inspire, connect, and empower.

I’m deeply interested in the intersection between software development, innovation, and creative problem-solving — building projects that merge technical precision with user-centered design.

I am currently working at AFri TechBridge Ltd as a software developer and a project manager. Afri TechBridge is a tech company based in Ghana that is committed to developing robust software solutions to businesses and also provides hands-on training programs for people that are seeking careering in software development, or wants to improve their IT and modern digital skills.

“Technology is not just about code — it’s about creating experiences that move people.”

## 🎯 Objective

To continuously grow as a software engineer by exploring cutting-edge technologies and developing impactful digital solutions.
My long-term goal is to contribute to innovative software ecosystems that advance creativity, education, and digital inclusion across Africa and beyond.
